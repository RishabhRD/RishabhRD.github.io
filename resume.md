### Education

- B.Tech in Computer Science, **IIIT Dharwad, CGPA: 9.1**, Graduated: May 2022

  (Awarded with **<ins>Director's Gold Medal for Best Outgoing Student</ins>**)

- Grade 12 (CBSE), Anil Saraswati Vidya Mandir, Ayodhya. **93.4%** in Boards March 2017

### Experience

- **Goodworker Technologies \[SDE-1\] (Jun 2022 - currently)**: Worked on
  various frameworks and microservices on backend side that directly or
  indirectly supported goodworker's product. Built a task library from scratch
  that was used in all microservices for scheduling asynchronous work. It also
  utilized **Functional Reactive Design**. Also developed an Authorization
  System microservice confronting OAuth2.0 Spec. Tech Stack used: **NodeJS, Typescript,
  RXJS**

- **Salesforce \[Intern\](Jan 2022 - Jun2022)**: Worked on enhancing
  performance of some of their product, by implementing low level constructs.
  Implemented a highly efficient, less-blocking **Thread Pool** for **p4-fusion** their open
  source project and removed **singleton design pattern** and added **strategy
  design pattern** for leaverging abstraction of scheduler. Tech Stack used: C++17, Javascript, Java

### Open Source & ISO C++ Standard contributions

- **std::expected (Part of C++23 now)**: Implemented the ISO standard
  C++ proposal **[P2505](http://wg21.link/p2505)** in C++20. The implementation
  is also acknowledged in the proposal. The motive of std::expected is to
  introduce a functional way of error handling in C++ standard library.

- **libunifex (Proposed for C++26)**: Implemented many unimplemented async
  algorithms proposed in **[P2300](https://wg21.link/p2300)** in **facebook's**
  libunifex library from scratch. Thus also got my **copyright** on those files in
  facebook's codebase. libunifex implements P2300's executors proposal
  (targetting C++26) that proposes methodology of generic execution of tasks
  over scheduler and proposes idea of structured concurrency.

### Publications / Journals

- **Denial of ARP Spoofing in SDN and NFV enabled Cloud-Fog-Edge Platform \[<ins>Cluster Computing Journal</ins>\]**

  Links: **[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03328-x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03328-x), [https://github.com/sdnnet/sdn_arp_spoof_detection](https://github.com/sdnnet/sdn_arp_spoof_detection)**

  In this work we are proposing a Denial of ARP spoofing approach to prevent
  internal ARP spoofing attack in SDN and NFV enabled Cloud-Fog-Edge platform.
  Unlike other approaches, DARPSpoof also prevents against DOS, DDOS and
  session hijacking attacks. It also significantly reduces the overhead towards
  SDN Controller in terms of flow rules and Packet-In and Packet-Out traffic.

- **Fairness and Applications’ transport protocol aware frame aggregation using programmable WLANs \[<ins>Wireless Networks Journal</ins>\]**

  In this work, we investigate major reasons for fairness issues, and propose a
  Fairness and Applications’ transport protocol aware frame aggregation (FAFA)
  scheme using Pro-APs The FAFA scheme is evaluated against existing schemes
  using extensive simulations with the Network Simulator-3 (NS-3).

### Projects

- **[libparse](https://github.com/RishabhRD/libparse):** A functional programming compile time string parsing library.
  This library defines some basic parsers and exposes functional programming
  based parser combinators for developing higher-order parsers. Given a string
  in compile time, the parsers can parse those strings in compile time itself.

- **[rssh](https://github.com/RishabhRD/rssh-server):** rssh allows tunneling
  ssh connections between client and server using an intermediate machine. It
  allows client client and server to communicate even if they are in private
  networks if intermediate machine is hosted on public VPS.

- **[nvim-lsputils](https://github.com/RishabhRD/nvim-lsputils)**: nvim-lsputils
  is lua plugin for neovim text editor that provide better frontend handler for
  nvim-lsp client. It has **390+ github stars**.

- **[nvim-cheat.sh](https://github.com/RishabhRD/nvim-cheat.sh)**: nvim-cheat.sh
  is lua plugin for neovim text editor that aims at reducing browsing by providing
  way to query programming questions from neovim itself. It has **130+ github stars.**
